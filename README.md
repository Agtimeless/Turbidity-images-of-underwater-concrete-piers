# Turbidity-images-of-underwater-concrete-piers
The dataset is used for image deturbidity of underwater concrete piers
Turbidity grade 0 refers to the images images taken in the air.
Turbidity grade 1 refers to images taken in water with turbidity less than 1NTU.
Turbidity grade 2 refers to images taken in water with turbidity between 4NTU and 6NTU.
Turbidity grade 3 refers to images taken in water with turbidity between 9NTU and 11NTU.
Turbidity grade 4 refers to images taken in water with turbidity between 14NTU and 16NTU.
Turbidity grade 5 refers to images taken in water with turbidity between 19NTU and 21NTU.
Turbidity grade 6 refers to images taken in water with turbidity between 24NTU and 26NTU.
Turbidity grade 6 refers to images taken in water with turbidity between 29NTU and 31NTU.
At present, the data set only includes the images of one pier under different turbidity, and we will supplement the dataset in the future
